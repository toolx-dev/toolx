# SuperToolFFMPEG Documentation

`SuperToolFFMPEG` is a utility class designed to facilitate interaction with FFMPEG processes within Node.js applications. It extends a provided superclass, enhancing it with methods for managing FFMPEG processes and tracking progress.

The superclass, often referred to as the base class or parent class, serves as the foundation upon which `SuperToolFFMPEG` builds its functionality. By extending a superclass, `SuperToolFFMPEG` inherits all the properties and methods of the superclass while adding its own unique capabilities related to FFMPEG processing.

::: info
The choice of superclass is flexible and depends on the specific requirements of your application. It could be any existing class or module that provides functionalities relevant to your FFMPEG processing needs. For instance, you might choose a generic tool class that provides file manipulation functions or a more specialized class tailored to your application domain.

By extending the superclass, `SuperToolFFMPEG` seamlessly integrates with your existing codebase, allowing you to leverage its enhanced FFMPEG capabilities while maintaining consistency with your application's overall architecture.

## Usage

To utilize the functionality provided by SuperToolFFMPEG, you should extend it from a superclass. Here's an example of how to extend it and use it within your application:

```javascript
import SuperToolFFMPEG from '@toolx/supertool-ffmpeg';

// Define a class ToolName extending SuperToolFFMPEG
class ToolName extends SuperToolFFMPEG(Tool) {
    // Your implementation goes here
}

// Instantiate ToolName and use its methods
const tool = new ToolName();
```
