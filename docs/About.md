# About ToolX

ToolX is a comprehensive library designed to streamline file processing tasks through a variety of methods such as media compression, transformation, and more. It is structured around two core concepts: `Tool` and `Pipeline`.

::: tip
Tools in ToolX can be combined using the Pipeline feature, where the output of one tool becomes the input for the next. This enables complex workflows, such as transforming an image format, composing it into a spritesheet, and finally compressing it, to be handled efficiently and seamlessly.
