# ToolX Library and TypeScript

The ToolX library creator has made a deliberate choice not to use TypeScript files. While TypeScript is appreciated, the library utilizes JSDocs for declaring types and generating `.d.ts` files, which suffices for type coverage needs.

## Embracing JSDocs Over TypeScript

JSDocs offer a robust way to document and declare types within JavaScript files. This approach maintains type safety and generates type definition files without the overhead of managing TypeScript files.

### Benefits of Using JSDocs:

- **Simplified Workflow**: Avoiding the transpilation of `.ts` files reduces dependencies and the complexity of the library.
- **Increased Coding Speed**: Utilizing native JavaScript with type documentation enables quicker development cycles. Developers can edit and run files directly, maintaining efficiency without significant compromises.
- **Direct Execution**: JavaScript files can be executed as-is, without the need for a separate compilation step, enhancing the development experience.

## Why TypeScript is Avoided in ToolX

While TypeScript offers many benefits, its inclusion would introduce additional layers of complexity and dependency management. By sticking to JavaScript and JSDocs, the library remains lightweight and straightforward, focusing on direct execution and ease of use.

### Exception: Small Libraries Around ToolX

TypeScript is used in smaller, ancillary libraries like `mustargs`. These libraries benefit from TypeScript's features without burdening the main ToolX library with additional complexity.

## Conclusion

The approach with ToolX prioritizes simplicity, speed, and direct execution, leveraging JSDocs for type management. This strategy aligns with the goal to create an efficient, easy-to-use, and agile development environment.
